# Gloucestershire Police Band

Welcome to the website of the Gloucestershire Police Band, also known as The Band of the Gloucestershire Constabulary.

<GlosPoliceBand />

The Gloucestershire Police Band was formed in 1990 and is based in Cheltenham.

We are a friendly, non-competing brass band that supports the Gloucestershire Constabulary by performing at engagements
in some of the countyâ€™s most prestigious venues. Our members include former police officers, civilian staff, ex-military
musicians and musicians from a variety of brass band backgrounds. The band has a wide repertoire of music suitable for any occasion,
and beyond our formal and ceremonial engagements we regularly undertake performances at community events such as
Pershore Midsummer Brass, charity concerts, and summer bandstands. We are proud of our extensive performance record in support of
charities.

We are always keen to attract new players, who will receive a warm and friendly welcome! We also welcome visitors who would like to
join us for a rehearsal. We rehearse in Cheltenham on Thursday evenings from 7.30pm to 9.30pm. Please contact us if you would like
to come along to a rehearsal.

For more information or to book the band for your event, please contact the band secretary
at <a href="mailto: secretary@glospoliceband.org">secretary@glospoliceband.org</a>.

Our recent CD is still available, <Link href="cdinfo">A Night at the Movies</Link>
