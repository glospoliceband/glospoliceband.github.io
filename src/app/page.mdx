# The Band of the Gloucestershire Constabulary

Welcome to the website of The Band of the Gloucestershire Constabulary, also known as the Gloucestershire Police Band.

<GlosPoliceBand />

The Band of the Gloucestershire Constabulary is based in Cheltenham.
Members include a mixture of former police officers, civilians working for the Police & people with absolutely no Police connection –
you don’t have to be a Police Officer to join!

Although we do not participate in brass band contests we strive to produce high quality musical performances at a range of events
including concerts (often supporting a charity), bandstands and fetes; Pershore Midsummer Brass has become a highlight of the year.

We support the Gloucestershire Constabulary at several events including the Emergency Services Carol Service
(either in Gloucester Cathedral or Tewkesbury Abbey) and the Constabulary Open Day.
We are privileged to support The Royal British Legion at their annual Festival of Remembrance and have had the
opportunity to perform at several other events in Gloucester Cathedral.

We practise in Cheltenham on a Thursday night and we're always open to new players and visitors.

Our recent CD is still available, <Link href="cdinfo">A Night at the Movies</Link>
